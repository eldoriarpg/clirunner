This small plugin allows execution of predefined scripts.

Configuration is simple.

Add your script to the scripts directory.\
Register your script like the example script in your default configuration.\

The allowArgs argument is used with care since it may allow to break out of the shell.
Commands are always executed with the script directory as the working directory.

Now you can execute them via the clirun command from your console or ingame. You will require the clirunner.run permission.

Use at your own risk. Letting someone execute scripts on your server might allow ppl to do bad things.
