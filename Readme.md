This small plugin allows execution of predefined scripts.

Place scripts in you scripts directory and add them to the config.

Now you can execute them via the clirun command from your console or ingame. You will require the clirunner.run permission.

Use at your own risk. Letting someone execute scripts on your server might allow ppl to do bad things.
